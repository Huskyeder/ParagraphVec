ParagraphVecCUDA
================

Project submission for CSCI-GA.3033-004 Graphics Processing Units (GPUs): Architecture and Programming

CUDA implementation of paragraph vector algorithm.

Just implements PV-DBOW Model (Paragraph Vector Distributed Bag of Words). 

Expects that you have already trained the word-vectors using gensim version of word2vec.

However, I plan to implement a version which would just take any corpus and generate both word vectors and document vectors.
